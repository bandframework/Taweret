# This action publishes distributions that it produces to the Taweret PyPI
# account.  Therefore, it has the ability to break that page or allow nefarious
# actors to alter it.  For more information on the security behind this action,
# please refer to

#        https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/security-model/
#
# ALL CHANGES TO THIS ACTION SHOULD BE REVIEWED VERY CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT
#             THE CHANGES ARE AS INTENDED AND WELL UNDERSTOOD!
